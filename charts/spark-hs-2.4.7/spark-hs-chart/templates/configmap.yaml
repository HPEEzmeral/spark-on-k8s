    #  syntax: [instance].sink|source.[name].[options]=[value]

    #  This file configures Spark's internal metrics system. The metrics system is
    #  divided into instances which correspond to internal components.
    #  Each instance can be configured to report its metrics to one or more sinks.
    #  Accepted values for [instance] are "master", "worker", "executor", "driver",
    #  and "applications". A wildcard "*" can be used as an instance name, in
    #  which case all instances will inherit the supplied property.
    #
    #  Within an instance, a "source" specifies a particular set of grouped metrics.
    #  there are two kinds of sources:
    #    1. Spark internal sources, like MasterSource, WorkerSource, etc, which will
    #    collect a Spark component's internal state. Each instance is paired with a
    #    Spark source that is added automatically.
    #    2. Common sources, like JvmSource, which will collect low level state.
    #    These can be added through configuration options and are then loaded
    #    using reflection.
    #
    #  A "sink" specifies where metrics are delivered to. Each instance can be
    #  assigned one or more sinks.
    #
    #  The sink|source field specifies whether the property relates to a sink or
    #  source.
    #
    #  The [name] field specifies the name of source or sink.
    #
    #  The [options] field is the specific property of this source or sink. The
    #  source or sink is responsible for parsing this property.
    #
    #  Notes:
    #    1. To add a new sink, set the "class" option to a fully qualified class
    #    name (see examples below).
    #    2. Some sinks involve a polling period. The minimum allowed polling period
    #    is 1 second.
    #    3. Wildcard properties can be overridden by more specific properties.
    #    For example, master.sink.console.period takes precedence over
    #    *.sink.console.period.
    #    4. A metrics specific configuration
    #    "spark.metrics.conf=${SPARK_HOME}/conf/metrics.properties" should be
    #    added to Java properties using -Dspark.metrics.conf=xxx if you want to
    #    customize metrics system. You can also put the file in ${SPARK_HOME}/conf
    #    and it will be loaded automatically.
    #    5. The MetricsServlet sink is added by default as a sink in the master,
    #    worker and driver, and you can send HTTP requests to the "/metrics/json"
    #    endpoint to get a snapshot of all the registered metrics in JSON format.
    #    For master, requests to the "/metrics/master/json" and
    #    "/metrics/applications/json" endpoints can be sent separately to get
    #    metrics snapshots of the master instance and applications. This
    #    MetricsServlet does not have to be configured.

    # org.apache.spark.metrics.source.JvmSource
    #   Note: Currently, JvmSource is the only available common source.
    #         It can be added to an instance by setting the "class" option to its
    #         fully qualified class name (see examples below).
